== Description ==

Integrates [Google reCAPTCHA](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/) with the affiliate registration of [Affiliates](https://wordpress.org/plugins/affiliates/), [Affiliates Pro](https://www.itthinx.com/shop/affiliates-pro/) and [Affiliates Enterprise](https://www.itthinx.com/shop/affiliates-enterprise/).

When you use the `[affiliates_dashboard]` or `[affiliates_dashboard_registration]` or `[affiliates_registration]` shortcode, and this extension has been configured with the correct Site Key and Secret Key for the Google reCAPTCHA, the reCAPTCHA will be displayed and verified on the affiliate registration form.
